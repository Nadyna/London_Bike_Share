# London Bike Share Analysis: Exploring bike-sharing demand in relation to weather factors and daily patterns

## Overview  
The goal of this analysis is to determine and evaluate the key factors associated with bike share ride volume.  
  
I analyzed historical bike-sharing data from Kaggle: [London Bike Sharing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset) to explore how factors like weather, time of day, season, and day type affect ride volume.

This dataset includes over 17,000 hourly records of bike rentals, with features such as:
    • Timestamp-based data (date, working day, holiday)
    • Weather conditions (temperature, temperature "feels like", humidity, wind speed, weather category, season)
    • Ride count (the count of new bike shares)
I chose this dataset because it offers rich temporal and environmental variables, which are ideal for exploring real-world patterns in transportation behavior and building practical, data-driven insights.
